# HW1 Scatter Plot
## Goals
- Implement a web-based scatter plot to show the attached iris dataset by using D3.
- Users should be able to determine the x-axis (and y-axis) to show the values of one of the attributes, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, when interacting with the tool.
- Render scatter points in different colors to represent the flower classes (three in total).
