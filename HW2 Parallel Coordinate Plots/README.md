# HW2 Parallel Coordinate Plot
## Goals
- Implement a web-based parallel coordinate plot to show the iris dataset using D3.
- Users should be able to change the order of the axis because the attribute relations are difficult to observe if they are far away.
- Render poly-lines (flower samples) in different hues to represent the flower classes (three in total).
