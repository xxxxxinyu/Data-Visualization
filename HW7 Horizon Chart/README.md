## Objective
Craft a horizon chart to represent air pollution data using D3.

**Data Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bappekim/air-pollution-in-seoul

- Districts & Pollutants: There are 25 districts in Seoul, and data is available for 6 different pollutants. This necessitates the creation of 150 horizon charts.

- Data Period: The dataset covers hourly readings from 2017 through 2019. For this assignment, you should let users focus solely on data from a specific year.

## Requirements
**Data Preparation**: Aggregate hourly data into daily summaries. You can use the mean, median, or another appropriate measure as a representative value for each day.

**Horizon Chart Creation**: Develop a horizon chart for each combination of district and pollutant, resulting in 150 charts. Ensure clear labeling for each chart indicating the district and pollutant it represents.

**Color Variations**: Use distinguishable colors for different pollutants to provide clear visual differentiation.

**Layout**: Organize charts in a grid or another systematic arrangement, ensuring easy comparison and identification.

**Interactivity (optional)**: Add features like tooltips for detailed daily values or zoom capabilities to focus on specific periods.
